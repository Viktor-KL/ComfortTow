#ComfortTown

Functional website for realty.

(My second website on next.js. I will make this project taking into account all the mistakes of the previous project (with commits, img sorting, clear code, not empty custom document, classnames without BEM, use Image component according to his appointment, not empty read.me file)

UPD. Last commit, I will not learn something new on this project, so will learn typescript and sass for develop next project on next level
